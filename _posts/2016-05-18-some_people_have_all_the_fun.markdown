I'm the father of two active little girls (4 years old and 1.5 years old). Over the last few months, both of my daughters have decided to take some of life's daily tasks into their own hands. They're both well aware that my wife and I are capable of taking care of their needs, but they've decided that they're just as capable of feeding, dressing, or bathing themselves. Food has been spilt, clothes rarely match, and I frequently wonder how effective their baths really are. However, with each attempt, they come to a greater understanding that their assumption was, in fact, correct. It turns out that they *can* do what their parents do. The limitations they once thought they had no longer exist and their independence and satisfaction in life increase. 

Now, this post isn't meant to be a parenting lesson. However, I believe the desire to achieve greater independence and satisfaction is a constant in life. Having been a non-technical employee, founder and turkey farmer (yes, you read that correctly), it's always been easier to depend on someone else to build and design this or that piece of software. I mean, all it takes is *some* code, right? It should *just* take you a day to build that...RIGHT?! Despite my naivet√©, my association with great programmers and designers helped me realize one thing: technical folk (that truly love their craft) have all the fun in the industry. Here are four reasons that prove I'm right: 

1. They can dream, build, and ship -- on their own. 
2. They're in a field that offers endless learning possibilities. 
3. The line between work and hobby can't easily be defined. 
4. Their services are in demand worldwide.

In conclusion, I chose to learn software development to achieve greater independence and experience the satisfaction that comes from continually learning and building. That sounds like a lot of fun to me. After all, programming is just ["making Lego out of words"](http://https://twitter.com/paulg/status/609007907045306368), right? I love Legos.
