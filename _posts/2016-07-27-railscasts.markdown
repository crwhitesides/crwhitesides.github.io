You know those people that [watch others play videos games](https://www.twitch.tv/)? Surely, some do it for pleasure and others do it to improve their skills. *Sidenote: If you doubt that gaming is a skill, you need to take time and meet someone that is a gamer. There is great skill there.*üëäüèæ  Today I used episode 196 of RailsCasts' screencasts to better understand nested forms in Rails. Although the curriculum's lesson regarding this topic is very clear and throrough, I found added enjoyment and understanding while watching someone else work with multiple models, nested attributes, and the primary model's `new.html.erb` view. It's enlightening to see another programmer's style and to hear their thought process (albeit somewhat scripted for the screenscast) as they work through a problem and come to a conclusion. This specific screencast (episode 196) was recorded in 2010. That's six years ago! It surely isn't relevant anymore. Wrong! As far as (basic) nested forms are concerned, things are pretty much the same. However, the great thing about RailsCasts or *watching* Avi or any other programmer slap away at a keyboard is that you get a taste for different programming styles and thought processes. Why does he prefer this framework? Why is she using that theme? What is the point of doing XY and Z that way? Man, look at her use those shortcuts! Over time, your style evolves and becomes a great mix of preferred ways to do this or that. In short, your style becomes your own. 


P.S. Thanks for the great screencasts, [Ryan](http://railscasts.com/)! Thanks for being a reliable source for all things Rails (and much more).
