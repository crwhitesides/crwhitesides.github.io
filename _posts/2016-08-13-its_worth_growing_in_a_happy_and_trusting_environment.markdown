[Ruby on Rails's doctrine](http://rubyonrails.org/doctrine/) is a worthwhile read. There are two key values of Ruby on Rails that I'd like to emphasize:

## Happiness

> "While the pursuit of happiness is hard to measure at the micro level, it’s a lot clearer to observe at the macro level. The Ruby on Rails community is full of people who are here precisely because of this pursuit. They boast of better, more fulfilled working lives. It’s in this aggregate of emotions that the victory is clear.
> 
> "So thus we conclude: Optimizing for happiness is perhaps the most formative key to Ruby on Rails. It shall remain such going forward."


## Trust

>  "The language and the framework should be patient tutors willing to help and guide anyone to experthood. While recognizing that the only reliable course there goes through the land of mistakes: Tools used wrong, a bit of blood, sweat, and perhaps even some tears. There simply is no other way.
> 
> "Ruby on Rails is an environment for chefs and those who wish to become chefs. You might start out doing the dishes, but you can work your way up to running the kitchen. Don’t let anyone tell you that you can’t be trusted with the best tool in the trade as part of that journey."
