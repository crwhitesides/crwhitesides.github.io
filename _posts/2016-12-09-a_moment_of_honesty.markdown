I could pick one of the many bugs I ran into while "jQuerifying" my rails app and I don't think I'd have much to say about how I found a solution. All I did was excessively google issues until I found a solution on Github or Stack Overflow. I'm a great googler aspiring to be a self-sufficient programmer. 

One thing I did learn from completing this project is the value of learning online. I'm referring to the value of Learn.co vs in-person bootcamps. I don't have a physical cohort I belong to. I don't have a schedule I have to adhere to. Whether I'm "in class" or not isn't being monitored. I don't worry about competing with my peers or looking ridiculous if I don't grasp a concept as quickly as the rest (who cares anyway?). My time is my own. Hurrah...right?

However, when the going gets tough, it's significantly easier to quit for all the reasons mentioned above. Your level of perserverance while learning online acts as a litmus test for determining interest in programming. Has that perserverance, to some degree, translated into passion? There's nobody to impress. It's okay to be honest with yourself. I love this about online learning. The pressures and noise of being in a classroom are nonexistent. 

*(For the record, I also love being in classrooms. However, online learning offers freedom, space and isolation that, if managed well, can be quite enlightening.)*
